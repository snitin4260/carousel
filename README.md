# Carousel

I wanted to build Carousel on my own without using any Frameworks as well as other web implementations. This is what I came up with. I made use of Arrays.
Initially, I made use of images which were 4 mb for each and caused a lot of delay for images to load. I  have lot of optimization in mind.
Maybe I can make use of  a package such as imagemin to reduce image file size as well as lazy load images. Another thing, I haven't minified the file, guess it can improve the performane.
